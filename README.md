## Blink Detection Experiments:

2019-2020 Spring CSE4097 - Graduation Project I

3 different blink detection methods are examined in the scope of graduation thesis as a side project. We were planning to uses these methods to extract blink-based features, but we gave up on these later.

1) **simple thresholding:** Eye-aspect-ratio based model with constant thresholds which defines a proper blink behaviour.

2) **adaptive model:** Same approach above with adaptive thresholds.

3) **machine learning model:** Completely different experiment with a machine learning approach.

#### Repo Content and Implementation Steps:

[**1.EDA**](https://github.com/mustafahakkoz/Text_Classification_ML-DL/tree/master/1.EDA)

- Exploratory Data Analysis for gaining insights about the data. We have examined the dataset using univariate and bivariate analysis.
- Also we determined on which attribute will be the target.
